# Arduino-Drone-Rocket-Launcher

This Repository is an extension of the YMFC-AL package by Joop Brokking (he's the bomb, some of the best coding and teaching on the internet I have ever seen, if you get a chance look him up!).  This extension add a 5 channel that allows you to control an add-on device like a relay or a ignitor.
